# Fix for bsec_selectivity.h Error

## The Problem
Arduino IDE can't find `bsec_selectivity.h` because:
- You're using a temporary sketch file instead of opening the actual file
- The header file needs to be in the same folder as the .ino file

## The Solution

### Option 1: Open the Actual File (BEST)

**Don't create a new sketch!** Instead:

1. In Arduino IDE: **File → Open**
2. Navigate to: `firmware/MycoBrain_SideA/MycoBrain_SideA.ino`
3. Click **Open**

This ensures:
- The `.ino` file is in its proper folder
- The `bsec_selectivity.h` file in the same folder will be found
- Everything compiles correctly

### Option 2: Use Without BSEC Config (CURRENT)

The code is now set to **work without** the BSEC config file:
```cpp
#define USE_EXTERNAL_BLOB 0  // Set to 0 = no config file needed
```

**This is fine!** BSEC will work, just without the optimized IAQ algorithm configuration. The sensors will still work perfectly.

### Option 3: Add File Manually

If you want to use the BSEC config:

1. Create/open your sketch
2. **Sketch → Add File...** (or right-click in sketch folder)
3. Navigate to `firmware/MycoBrain_SideA/bsec_selectivity.h`
4. Select it
5. Change `#define USE_EXTERNAL_BLOB 0` to `1` in the code

## Current Status

✅ **Code updated to work WITHOUT config file**
- Set `USE_EXTERNAL_BLOB` to `0`
- BSEC will work without optimized config
- Sensors will function normally
- IAQ calculations will still work

## Recommendation

**Just open the actual file:**
```
File → Open → firmware/MycoBrain_SideA/MycoBrain_SideA.ino
```

This is the easiest and ensures everything works correctly!
