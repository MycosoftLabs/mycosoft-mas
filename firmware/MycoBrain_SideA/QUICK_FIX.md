# Quick Fix for bsec_selectivity.h Error

## Problem
Arduino IDE can't find `bsec_selectivity.h` file.

## Solution 1: Open the Actual File (Recommended)

**Don't create a new sketch!** Instead:

1. **File → Open**
2. Navigate to: `firmware/MycoBrain_SideA/MycoBrain_SideA.ino`
3. Click **Open**

This ensures the `.h` file in the same folder is found.

## Solution 2: Add File to Sketch Folder

If you must use a new sketch:

1. Create new sketch
2. Copy `MycoBrain_SideA.ino` content
3. **Sketch → Add File...**
4. Select `bsec_selectivity.h` from `firmware/MycoBrain_SideA/` folder
5. The file will appear in a new tab

## Solution 3: Code Updated (Works Without Config)

The code has been updated to work **without** the BSEC config file if it's not found. BSEC will still work, just without the optimized IAQ algorithm configuration.

## Verification

After opening the file correctly, you should see:
- Tab 1: `MycoBrain_SideA` (the .ino file)
- Tab 2: `bsec_selectivity` (the .h file) - if file exists

If you don't see the .h file tab, that's OK - the code will work without it.

## Next Steps

1. Open the actual `.ino` file (not create new sketch)
2. Verify board: **ESP32S3 Dev Module**
3. Upload

The firmware will work with or without the BSEC config file!
