|------|-------------|----------|
| rebaseline-firmware | Firmware baseline doc | `docs/MYCOBRAIN_FIRMWARE_BASELINE_REBASELINE_MAR07_2026.md` |
| device-jetson16-architecture | 16GB Jetson cortex architecture | `docs/DEVICE_JETSON16_CORTEX_ARCHITECTURE_MAR07_2026.md` |
| gateway-jetson4-lilygo | 4GB Jetson + LilyGO gateway | `docs/GATEWAY_JETSON4_LILYGO_ARCHITECTURE_MAR07_2026.md` |
| protocol-contracts | MDP rail + gateway upstream contracts | `docs/MDP_PROTOCOL_CONTRACTS_MAR07_2026.md` |
| firmware-roadmap | Side A and Side B refactor plan | `docs/MYCOBRAIN_FIRMWARE_ROADMAP_MAR07_2026.md` |
| device-network-awareness | Edge/gateway awareness + manifest updates | `docs/DEVICE_NETWORK_EDGE_GATEWAY_AWARENESS_MAR07_2026.md`; `capability_manifest.py`; `device-products.ts` |
| operator-safety | Edge operator safety, audit, approval, rollback | `docs/EDGE_OPERATOR_SAFETY_MAR07_2026.md` |

## Code Changes

- **MAS `capability_manifest.py`**: Gateway capabilities extended with `sim`, `store_and_forward`
- **MycoBrain service `capability_manifest.py`**: Same
- **Website `device-products.ts`**: CAPABILITY_DISPLAY extended with `sim`, `store_and_forward`, `edge_cortex`

## Next Steps (Implementation Phases)

The plan defines implementation phases. Architecture and protocol docs are done. Next work:

1. **Phase 3** — Side A firmware: MDP framing, command family alignment, estop
2. **Phase 4** — Side B firmware: MDP, transport directives, LoRa/BLE/WiFi/SIM
3. **Phase 2** — Jetson16 edge operator runtime: Audit logging, proposal API, approval flow
4. **Phase 5** — 4GB Jetson + LilyGO gateway node build and deploy
5. **Phase 6** — Stack/UI: Optional topology enhancements for gateway/relayed devices

## Verification

- All plan todos marked complete
- MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX updated with new docs
- Canonical device identity invariants documented and preserved
