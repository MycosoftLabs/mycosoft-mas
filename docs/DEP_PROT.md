# Mycosoft MAS Dependency Management Protocol

## Overview

This document outlines the dependency management protocol for the Mycosoft Multi-Agent System (MAS). The protocol ensures consistent, secure, and maintainable dependency management across all components of the system.

## Core Principles

1. **Immutable, Isolated Builds**
   - All dependencies are locked to specific versions
   - Each service runs in its own Docker container
   - Builds are reproducible byte-for-byte

2. **Semantic Versioning**
   - Direct dependencies are pinned to exact versions
   - Minor version updates are allowed after passing tests
   - Major version updates require explicit approval

3. **Automated Conflict Detection**
   - CI pipeline checks for dependency conflicts
   - Security vulnerabilities are automatically scanned
   - SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is maintained

4. **Zero-Downtime Updates**
   - Rolling updates for containerized services
   - Blue/green deployment capability
   - Automated rollback on failure

## Dependency Management Tools

### Poetry
- Primary dependency management tool
- Manages Python package dependencies
- Generates lock files and requirements.txt
- Handles virtual environments

### Docker
- Containerizes services
- Provides isolation between components
- Enables reproducible builds
- Supports multi-stage builds

### GitHub Actions
- Automates dependency updates
- Runs security scans
- Manages CI/CD pipelines
- Handles automated PR creation

## Update Process

1. **Weekly Automated Updates**
   - GitHub Actions runs weekly dependency updates
   - Creates PR with updated dependencies
   - Runs test suite and security scans
   - Requires approval before merging

2. **Manual Updates**
   - Run `scripts/update_deps.sh`
   - Follow PR process for review
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Emergency Updates**
   - For critical security fixes
   - Can bypass normal PR process
   - Requires post-update review

## Security Considerations

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Weekly automated scans
   - Immediate alerts for critical issues
   - Regular dependency audits

2. **Access Control**
   - Limited access to dependency updates
   - Required approvals for major changes
   - Audit trail of all updates

3. **Supply Chain Security**
   - SBOM generation and tracking
   - Dependency provenance verification
   - Regular security updates

## Monitoring and Alerts

1. **Dependency Health**
   - Automated monitoring of dependency status
   - Alerts for outdated packages
   - Security vulnerability notifications

2. **Build Status**
   - CI pipeline status monitoring
   - Build failure notifications
   - Test coverage tracking

3. **Runtime Monitoring**
   - Service health checks
   - Performance metrics
   - Error rate tracking

## Rollback Procedures

1. **Automated Rollback**
   - Triggered by health check failures
   - Reverts to last known good state
   - Notifies team of rollback

2. **Manual Rollback**
   - Documentation of rollback steps
   - Required approvals
   - Post-mortem analysis

## Documentation Requirements

1. **Dependency Updates**
   - Changelog entries
   - Update rationale
   - Impact assessment

2. **Configuration Changes**
   - Environment variable updates
   - Build configuration changes
   - Runtime configuration updates

3. **Security Updates**
   - Vulnerability details
   - Mitigation steps
   - Post-update verification

## Approval Process

1. **Minor Updates**
   - Automated PR creation
   - Required test passing
   - One team member approval

2. **Major Updates**
   - Manual PR creation
   - Impact assessment
   - Team lead approval
   - Security team review

3. **Security Updates**
   - Immediate review
   - Security team approval
   - Post-update verification
