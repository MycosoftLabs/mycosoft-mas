# Cursor Docs Indexing and Notion (Feb 12, 2026)

## Why Cursor isn’t “aware” of all 2000+ docs automatically

1. **Context window limit**  
   Cursor does not load every file in the workspace into the conversation. Only a limited amount of text can be in context at once. So even if 2000+ docs exist on disk, they are not all “visible” unless an agent or user explicitly opens them or uses an index.

2. **No built-in full-doc index**  
   Cursor has no feature that automatically indexes every `.md` file and injects it into context. We therefore maintain:
   - **`.cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md`** – Curated list of **vital and current** docs. Agents are instructed to read this first. It is updated so that **new docs replace old ones** in the list.
   - **`.cursor/docs_manifest.json`** – Machine-readable list of (path, title, date, repo) for all discovered `.md` files. Generated by `python scripts/build_docs_manifest.py`. Agents use this to discover docs then open the file by path.
   - **`docs/MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX.md`** – Full table of contents with short descriptions.

3. **Notion is a one-way sync target**  
   We push docs **to Notion** for human and team use (see `docs/NOTION_DOCS_SYNC_SYSTEM_FEB08_2026.md`). That sync is **one-way: repo → Notion**. Cursor does not read from Notion. So:
   - **Cursor only sees local files** in the workspace.
   - To have Cursor “see” content, it must exist in the repo and be either listed in `.cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md` / `docs/MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX.md` or discoverable via `.cursor/docs_manifest.json` or search (Grep / Glob / semantic search).

## How we keep “vital and new” in front of Cursor

- **`.cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md`** is the single internal reference for Cursor: vital and current docs only. When a doc is superseded, remove the old entry and add the new one. Do not let the list grow with deprecated docs.
- **`docs/MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX.md`** remains the full TOC; it can retain older sections for reference, but the **primary list agents are told to read first** is CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.
- **Regenerate the manifest** when many new docs are added: `python scripts/build_docs_manifest.py`. This updates `.cursor/docs_manifest.json` so full-doc discovery stays accurate.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why doesn’t Cursor see 2000+ docs? | Context limit; no auto-load of every file. Use CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX + docs_manifest.json + MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX. |
| Why doesn’t Cursor read Notion? | Notion is a one-way sync for humans. Cursor only uses local workspace files. |
| How do we replace old docs with new? | Keep `.cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md` updated: add new vital docs, remove superseded ones. |
| How do agents find any doc? | Use `.cursor/docs_manifest.json` (or Glob/Grep/semantic search), then open the file by path. |
