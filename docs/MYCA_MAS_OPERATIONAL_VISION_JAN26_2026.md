## Self-Assembly & Evolution

### How Agents Learn & Grow

Every interaction changes agent behavior through these mechanisms:

1. **Connection Updates**
   - New data sources → New capabilities
   - Agent connections → Collaborative intelligence
   - External integrations → Expanded reach

2. **Memory Accumulation**
   - Short-term: Recent observations, conversation context
   - Long-term: Knowledge base, learned patterns, historical decisions
   - Vector storage: Semantic understanding of all data

3. **Code Evolution**
   - Gap detection → New agent spawning
   - Performance patterns → Strategy optimization
   - Error analysis → Self-correction routines

4. **Behavioral Cascades**
   When one agent learns something new:
   - Memory Manager stores the insight
   - Orchestrator is notified of new capability
   - Related agents receive context updates
   - Task routing adjusts to utilize new skills
   - Goals and priorities may shift

### Self-Awareness Architecture

MYCA maintains awareness through:

1. **State Reflection**: Continuous self-monitoring of all agent states
2. **Performance Analytics**: Real-time metrics on efficiency and accuracy
3. **Goal Alignment**: Constant comparison of actions vs. mission objectives
4. **Resource Optimization**: Self-tuning of compute and memory allocation
5. **Error Recovery**: Automatic detection and resolution of failures
