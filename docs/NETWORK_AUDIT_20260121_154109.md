Network Audit Summary - 2026-01-21 15:41:09
=====================================================

Infrastructure Overview:
- Total Devices Scanned: 11
- Devices Online: 6
- Devices Offline: 5
- Overall Health: CRITICAL

Critical Issues Found: 2
- WiFi AP throughput severely degraded (10Gig -> 2.5Gig -> 30Mbps)
- Root cause: Likely cable or PoE switch limitation

Recommendations:
1. IMMEDIATE: Audit cabling from PoE switches to WiFi APs
2. IMMEDIATE: Check PoE switch port speed capabilities
3. SHORT-TERM: Replace any Cat 5e/6 runs with Cat 6a minimum
4. MEDIUM-TERM: Consider upgrading PoE switches to 2.5Gbe models

Cable Upgrades Needed: 2
Physical Routing Changes: 2

## Bottlenecks Identified

### CRITICAL: 192.168.0.10
- **Role**: ubiquiti_ap_1
- **Issue**: WiFi throughput severely degraded: 30 Mbps vs expected 2500 Mbps
- **Recommendations**:
  - Check uplink cable - may be Cat 5e limiting to 100Mbps
  - Verify PoE switch port is 1Gig+ capable
  - Check AP firmware is up to date
  - Verify 2.5Gbe port is negotiating at full speed
  - Consider dedicated Cat 8 or Cat 6a run to each AP
  - Check for interference or channel congestion

### CRITICAL: 192.168.0.11
- **Role**: ubiquiti_ap_2
- **Issue**: WiFi throughput severely degraded: 30 Mbps vs expected 2500 Mbps
- **Recommendations**:
  - Check uplink cable - may be Cat 5e limiting to 100Mbps
  - Verify PoE switch port is 1Gig+ capable
  - Check AP firmware is up to date
  - Verify 2.5Gbe port is negotiating at full speed
  - Consider dedicated Cat 8 or Cat 6a run to each AP
  - Check for interference or channel congestion

## Cable Upgrade Recommendations

| Device | Current | Recommended | Priority | Expected Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 192.168.0.10 | poe_cat6 | Cat 6a or Cat 8 | HIGH | 30 Mbps -> 2500 Mbps (83x improvement) |
| 192.168.0.11 | poe_cat6 | Cat 6a or Cat 8 | HIGH | 30 Mbps -> 2500 Mbps (83x improvement) |

## Physical Routing Improvements

### WiFi AP uplink chain
**Current Path**: Fiber Router → 10G Switch → Dream Machine → PoE Switch → WiFi APs

- 1. Verify PoE switch supports 2.5Gbe on AP ports
- 2. Replace Cat 5e/6 runs to APs with Cat 6a minimum
- 3. If PoE switch is only 1Gig, upgrade to 2.5Gbe PoE+ switch
- 4. Consider shorter cable runs or fiber SFP+ for long runs
- 5. Check if APs are daisy-chained (reduces bandwidth)

### 10Gig server backbone
**Current Path**: Fiber Router → 10G Switch → Dell Servers

- 1. Ensure all server NICs are 10Gbase-T or SFP+
- 2. Use Cat 8 for runs under 30m for 10Gig
- 3. For longer runs, consider fiber with SFP+ modules
- 4. Verify switch ports are all negotiating at 10Gbps
