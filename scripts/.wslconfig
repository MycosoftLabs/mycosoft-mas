# Copy this file to: C:\Users\<YourUser>\.wslconfig
# Then run: wsl --shutdown
# Restart WSL when needed. This prevents vmmem from using 50%+ of system RAM.

[wsl2]
# Cap memory so vmmem doesn't starve the rest of the system
memory=4GB
# Limit processors if you have many cores
processors=4
# Reduce swap (default 25% of RAM can be huge)
swap=1GB
