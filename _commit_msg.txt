feat(voice): add fully containerized voice interaction system with orchestrator integration

Added comprehensive voice interaction capabilities with local-first architecture:

Voice System:
- Integrated faster-whisper-server (STT), Ollama (LLM), and openedai-speech (TTS) in docker-compose
- Created voice UI with Nginx reverse proxy to resolve CORS issues
- Added /voice/orchestrator/chat and /voice/orchestrator/speech endpoints to MAS orchestrator
- Implemented conversation memory and multi-turn dialogue support

Infrastructure Integration:
- Added Proxmox VE and UniFi Network integrations with client libraries
- Created bootstrap scripts for automated infrastructure provisioning
- Added network management tools for UniFi/Proxmox API access

Agent Improvements (MYCA requested):
- Added persistent feedback loop with SQLite store for agent/orchestrator learning
- Implemented robust error handling with request IDs and global exception handler
- Added concurrency controls and worker pools for multi-threaded voice processing
- Created feedback API endpoints (POST /voice/feedback, GET /voice/feedback/recent, GET /voice/feedback/summary)

n8n Integration:
- Added n8n service with voice and text chat workflows
- Created workflow templates for STT->LLM->TTS pipeline
- Configured n8n with proper auth and encryption keys

Dependencies:
- Added python-multipart, jinja2, packaging, asyncpg to support voice/web features
- Updated poetry.lock with all new dependencies
- Set MAS_LIGHT_IMPORT mode to avoid loading heavyweight agent deps until needed

All voice services run in containers on mas-network for secure, local-first operation.
