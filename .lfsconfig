# LFS CONFIGURED FOR PUSH SUPPORT - Feb 10, 2026
# Cursor's git integration spawns git-lfs in the background repeatedly.
# Each failed LFS download leaves a 7-15 GB temp file in .git/lfs/tmp/.
# Over days this filled the entire 8TB drive with 1.74TB of garbage.
# fetchexclude = * prevents Cursor from auto-downloading large files.
# concurrenttransfers = 1 is minimum safe value to allow pushes while limiting download parallelism.
