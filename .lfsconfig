# LFS FULLY DISABLED - Feb 6, 2026 (NEVER CHANGE THIS)
# Cursor's git integration spawns git-lfs in the background repeatedly.
# Each failed LFS download leaves a 7-15 GB temp file in .git/lfs/tmp/.
# Over days this filled the entire 8TB drive with 1.74TB of garbage.
# This config prevents LFS from doing ANYTHING.
# See: docs/PERSONAPLEX_LFS_INCIDENT_AND_PREVENTION_FEB06_2026.md
