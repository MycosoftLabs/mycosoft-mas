# logs/

Runtime log output directory for the MAS Orchestrator and its agents.

## Purpose

This directory stores runtime log files generated by the MAS system during execution. Logs are written by Python's `logging` module and configured in `mycosoft_mas/core/myca_main.py`.

## Contents

Log files are generated at runtime and are not committed to Git. Typical files:
- `mas_orchestrator.log` -- Main orchestrator log
- `agent_*.log` -- Per-agent log files (when agent-level logging is enabled)

## Notes

- This directory is intentionally empty in the repository. Log files are created at runtime.
- Production logs are managed by Docker (`docker logs`) and systemd (`journalctl`) on VM 188.
- For monitoring, see `mycosoft_mas/monitoring/` and Prometheus on port 9090.
