# WiFiSense CSI Processing Module
# MINDEX extension for WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) based sensing
#
# Phase 0: Presence detection using RSSI patterns
# Phase 1: Motion detection using CSI amplitude variance
# Phase 2: Pose estimation using CSI phase information
#
# This module provides processing for WiFi CSI data from MycoBrain devices
# for radio-based sensing of presence, motion, and environmental changes.
