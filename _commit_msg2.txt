feat(voice): add ElevenLabs premium TTS, feedback UI, and comprehensive n8n workflow

MYCA-requested improvements implemented:

1. Error Handling:
- Added global exception handler with structured JSON error responses
- Implemented request ID tracking (X-Request-Id header on all responses)
- Added retry logic and timeout handling for all external service calls
- Improved error context in logs with request IDs

2. Agent Feedback Loop:
- Created persistent feedback store (SQLite) at data/voice_feedback.db
- Added feedback API: POST /voice/feedback, GET /voice/feedback/recent, GET /voice/feedback/summary
- Orchestrator system prompt now includes feedback stats for continuous learning
- Voice UI includes thumbs up/down buttons + notes textarea for every response
- Automatic feedback injection into orchestrator context

3. Multi-threading / Concurrency:
- Added semaphore-based concurrency limits for STT/LLM/TTS operations
- Implemented background worker pool (configurable via MAS_WORKER_COUNT)
- Switched to shared httpx.AsyncClient for connection pooling
- Database operations run in thread pool to avoid blocking event loop
- Supports parallel voice requests without race conditions

Additional Features:
- ElevenLabs TTS proxy with OpenAI-compatible API and automatic fallback to local TTS
- Voice mapping system for premium voices (including "scarlett" style)
- Comprehensive n8n workflow template with MAS orchestrator + Zapier MCP integration
- Updated voice UI to use MAS orchestrator endpoints directly (STT+LLM+TTS in one call)
- Added conversation context tracking across multiple turns
- Created detailed documentation (VOICE_SYSTEM_SETUP.md, N8N_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)

All improvements tested and verified working in containerized environment.
