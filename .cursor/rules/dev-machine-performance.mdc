# Dev Machine Performance (All Agents)

## Why the machine gets slow
- **npm run dev** (website) starts **GPU Services** in a **separate window** (PersonaPlex/Moshi, Bridge, Earth2). Those processes are **detached** and **keep running** after you close the terminal or Cursor.
- Left running for days they use huge CPU/RAM and make Cursor + whole machine slow. Docker/WSL alone are not the cause; **accumulated GPU Python processes + vmmem** are.
- **vmmem** = WSL2 VM (often used by Docker Desktop). It can use a lot of RAM; shutting it down when not needed frees memory.

## Rules for agents
1. **Never run the dev server or GPU services inside Cursor’s terminal** — it increases OOM risk. Tell the user to run from an **external terminal** (see `.cursor/rules/oom-prevention.mdc` and `docs/OOM_PREVENTION_FEB18_2026.md`).
2. **When suggesting or running the website dev server** and the user does NOT need voice or Earth2: use **npm run dev:next-only** (or **npm run dev:no-gpu**), NOT **npm run dev**, so GPU Services never start. Always instruct: run from external terminal, e.g. `scripts\start-dev.cmd` in WEBSITE/website.
3. **When the user reports slowness, lag, "machine slow", or Cursor OOM**: remind them to run the cleanup script and optionally shut down WSL:
   ```powershell
   cd scripts
   .\dev-machine-cleanup.ps1 -KillStaleGPU -ShutdownWSL
   ```
   Then restart Cursor if still slow. See `docs/WHY_DEV_MACHINE_SLOW_FEB06_2026.md` and `docs/WSL_VMMEM_DISABLE_FEB06_2026.md`.
5. **When documenting or instructing** use of `npm run dev`: add that when done with GPU features they should **close the "GPU Services" window** or run `scripts\dev-machine-cleanup.ps1 -KillStaleGPU` so Python processes don't run for days.

## Key paths
- Cleanup script: `scripts/dev-machine-cleanup.ps1` (-KillStaleGPU, -ShutdownWSL)
- WSL shutdown only: `scripts/shutdown-wsl-free-vmmem.ps1` or `wsl --shutdown`
- Root cause doc: `docs/WHY_DEV_MACHINE_SLOW_FEB06_2026.md`
- WSL/vmmem doc: `docs/WSL_VMMEM_DISABLE_FEB06_2026.md`
- **Cursor OOM prevention:** `docs/OOM_PREVENTION_FEB18_2026.md` and `.cursor/rules/oom-prevention.mdc`

## Website dev server: always on with Cursor
- The website dev server (port 3010) is **on whenever Cursor is on** — we use Cursor only for the website and its apps/tools. **Do not stop the dev server**; keep it running. See `.cursor/rules/autostart-services.mdc`.

## Website dev commands
- **npm run dev** – starts Next.js + GPU Services (new window); GPU processes keep running after terminal close.
- **npm run dev:next-only** or **npm run dev:no-gpu** – Next.js only on port 3010; no GPU Services. Prefer when voice/Earth2 not needed. Use this to start the dev server; do not turn it off when done.
