# DEPRECATED: MAS unifi-dashboard (NEVER USE)

## CRITICAL WARNING

The `unifi-dashboard` directory in the MAS repo (`mycosoft-mas/unifi-dashboard/`) is **DEPRECATED** and must **NEVER** be used, edited, run, or referenced for any development work.

## What is Deprecated

| Item | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `unifi-dashboard/` directory | `MAS/mycosoft-mas/unifi-dashboard/` | ❌ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE |
| Port 3001 | MAS Dashboard | ❌ DEPRECATED |
| Port 3100 | Old MYCA UniFi Dashboard | ❌ DEPRECATED |
| Any `npm run dev` from MAS repo | `mycosoft-mas/` | ❌ WRONG - Never run website from MAS |

## What is CORRECT

| Item | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Website repo | `WEBSITE/website/` | ✅ CORRECT |
| Dev port | **3010** | ✅ CORRECT |
| Dev command | `npm run dev:next-only` from WEBSITE/website | ✅ CORRECT |
| All UI pages | `WEBSITE/website/app/` | ✅ CORRECT |
| All components | `WEBSITE/website/components/` | ✅ CORRECT |

## The Two Repos Are Different

### MAS Repo (mycosoft-mas/) - Python Backend
- **Purpose**: Python backend, agents, orchestrator, FastAPI APIs
- **Language**: Python
- **VM**: 192.168.0.188 (port 8001)
- **NEVER run npm/website commands from here**
- **The unifi-dashboard/ folder is DEAD CODE**

### Website Repo (WEBSITE/website/) - Next.js Frontend
- **Purpose**: User-facing website, UI, React components, Next.js pages
- **Language**: TypeScript/React
- **Dev Port**: 3010
- **Prod VM**: 192.168.0.187 (port 3000)
- **ALL website work happens here**

## Agent Rules

### When asked to "run the dev server" or "start the website":
1. **ALWAYS** work from `C:\Users\admin2\Desktop\MYCOSOFT\CODE\WEBSITE\website\`
2. **ALWAYS** use port 3010
3. **ALWAYS** run `npm run dev:next-only` (or `npm run dev` only if voice/Earth2 needed)
4. **NEVER** run any npm commands from the MAS repo
5. **NEVER** start anything on port 3001 or 3100

### When editing website pages or components:
1. **ALWAYS** edit files in `WEBSITE/website/`
2. **NEVER** edit files in `mycosoft-mas/unifi-dashboard/`
3. Paths must start with `WEBSITE/website/app/` for pages
4. Paths must start with `WEBSITE/website/components/` for components

### Detection: Am I in the wrong directory?
If you see any of these paths, STOP and switch to the correct repo:
- `mycosoft-mas/unifi-dashboard/` → ❌ WRONG
- `MAS/mycosoft-mas/src/app/` → ❌ WRONG (no such thing)
- `mycosoft-mas/src/components/` → ❌ WRONG

Correct paths look like:
- `WEBSITE/website/app/test-voice/page.tsx` → ✅ CORRECT
- `WEBSITE/website/components/` → ✅ CORRECT

## History

The `unifi-dashboard` was an early prototype built in the MAS repo before the proper website repo existed. It was deprecated on **February 3, 2026** and all components were migrated to the website repo. The directory still exists but is **dead code** and should eventually be deleted.
