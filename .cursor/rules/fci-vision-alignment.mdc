# FCI / HPL / Mycorrhizae Vision Alignment

## When this rule applies

You are editing or planning work that touches:

- **FCI** (Fungal Computer Interface): electrodes, bioelectric signals, fungal probes, signal processing, MycoBrain FCI firmware
- **HPL** (Hypha Programming Language): signal patterns, device modules, DSL, Mycorrhizae protocol message types
- **Mycorrhizae protocol**: transport, semantic layer, GFST patterns, stimulus commands, bridges to insights

## Before implementing or designing

1. **Read the vision–implementation gap** so you don’t build in ignorance of the stated vision:
   - `docs/VISION_VS_IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_ANALYSIS_FEB10_2026.md`
2. **Read the scientific basis** for fungal electrical signaling (ranges, methods, species):
   - `docs/FUNGI_ELECTRICAL_SIGNALING_SCIENCE_FEB10_2026.md`
3. **Align with existing specs** where they exist:
   - Mycorrhizae: `Mycorrhizae/mycorrhizae-protocol/docs/MYCORRHIZAE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION_FEB10_2026.md`
   - FCI implementation: `docs/FCI_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_FEB10_2026.md`

## Rule of thumb

- Vision: two-way fungal communication, biological computation, mycological index, GFST validation.
- Current: data structures, routing, minimal DSL, PostgreSQL.
- When adding features in FCI/HPL/Mycorrhizae space, prefer steps that close the gap (e.g. real signal acquisition, pattern library, HPL patterns) over more routing-only work, unless the task is explicitly scoped to routing/infra.
