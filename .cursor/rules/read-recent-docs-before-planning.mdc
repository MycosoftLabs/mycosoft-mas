# Read Recent Docs Before Planning (All Agents)

## MANDATORY: Context Loading Before Any Plan, Task, or Implementation

Before ANY agent creates a plan, writes new code, makes architectural decisions, or starts a new task in any Mycosoft repository, it MUST first load recent documentation context.

---

## Required Steps (in order)

### 1. Read the Master Document Index
- Read `docs/MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX.md` to get the full table of contents.

### 2. Identify All Docs from the Last 4 Weeks
- Scan `docs/` for all `.md` files with dates in the last 4 weeks (28 days from today).
- Date format in filenames: `*_MMMDD_YYYY.md` (e.g., `STATUS_FEB09_2026.md`).
- Sort by date, newest first.

### 3. Read the Newest Docs First
- Read **all** docs from the last 7 days in full.
- Read **titles and first 20 lines** of docs from days 8-28 to get context.
- Pay special attention to:
  - Status documents (current system state)
  - Security documents (active vulnerabilities, fixes)
  - Architecture documents (system structure)
  - Deployment documents (what's running where)
  - Bug fix documents (known issues and resolutions)

### 4. Read Key Registries
Always read these before any work:
- `docs/MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX.md` -- Table of contents
- `docs/SYSTEM_REGISTRY_FEB04_2026.md` -- Systems, APIs, agents, services, devices
- `docs/API_CATALOG_FEB04_2026.md` -- API catalog
- `docs/system_map.md` -- System map

### 5. Check the Prioritization Document
- Read `docs/Code and System Prioritization.docx.md` for current priorities, execution order, and what has been planned vs implemented.

## Why This Rule Exists

- The Mycosoft ecosystem has 500,000+ files across 9 repos.
- Over 240 documentation files have been created in the last 4 weeks alone.
- Agents that skip context loading create duplicate work, conflicting implementations, and miss critical security or architectural decisions.
- This rule prevents "rabbit holes" where agents build from ignorance.

## When to Apply

| Scenario | Required? |
|----------|-----------|
| Creating a new plan | YES -- full context load |
| Starting a new coding task | YES -- at minimum read last 7 days |
| Fixing a bug | YES -- read related docs |
| Answering a question about the system | YES -- read relevant registries |
| Continuing work from a previous session | YES -- read docs created since last session |
| Simple file edit (typo fix, comment update) | NO -- skip if trivially scoped |

---

## How to Do This Efficiently

1. Use the `explore` subagent to scan `docs/` directories across all repos in parallel.
2. Use `Glob` to find `docs/*_FEB*_2026.md` and similar patterns for recent months.
3. Read document titles and first lines to triage relevance before deep-reading.
4. Cache context: once loaded in a session, you do not need to reload unless the user mentions new docs were created.

---

## Enforcement

- If an agent is found to have created a plan or made architectural changes without reading recent docs, the plan should be invalidated and redone with proper context.
- All plans must include a "Context Sources" section listing which docs were read.
- The `plan-tracker` agent should verify context loading on new plans.
