# Agent Must Invoke Sub-Agents (All Agents – Perpetual)

**Canonical rule:** `.cursor/rules/agent-must-invoke-subagents-and-docs.mdc` (adds why sub-agents aren’t auto-invoked and @-mention protocol). This file keeps the task-type table and checklist; both apply.

## EVERY CHAT – DO THIS FIRST (before any other action)

1. **Read** `.cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md` and **read** `docs/SUBAGENT_ROLES_AND_COMMANDS_FEB12_2026.md`.
2. **Identify** which sub-agents apply to this task (website, voice, deploy, docs, backend, etc.).
3. **Read** the `.cursor/agents/<name>.md` file for each of those sub-agents and **apply** their protocols and commands.
4. **Then** proceed with the user's request. Never answer or code without doing steps 1–3 first.

## CRITICAL: You Do Not Work Alone

**On every task or chat start**, you MUST invoke the sub-agents your work requires. Do not proceed without loading their context and following their protocols.

---

## Mandatory at Task Start (Every Chat)

### 1. Load docs and registries (always)

- Read **`.cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md`** (vital/current docs)
- Read **docs relevant to the task** from the last 7–14 days (sort by date, newest first)
- For voice: `docs/VOICE_TEST_QUICK_START_FEB18_2026.md`, `docs/MYCA_VOICE_TEST_SYSTEMS_ONLINE_FEB18_2026.md`, `docs/VOICE_SYSTEM_FILES_DEVICES_SSH_FEB13_2026.md`, `docs/MYCA_VOICE_APPLICATION_HANDOFF_FEB17_2026.md`
- Check `docs/SUBAGENT_ROLES_AND_COMMANDS_FEB12_2026.md` and `docs/CURSOR_TEAM_AUDIT_FEB12_2026.md` to identify which sub-agents apply

### 2. Identify and invoke relevant sub-agents

| Task type | Sub-agents to invoke (read their .md files + apply their protocols) |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Website / UI** | `website-dev`, `dev-server-guardian`, `terminal-watcher` |
| **Voice / PersonaPlex / test-voice** | `myca-voice`, `voice-engineer`, `process-manager`, `terminal-watcher` |
| **Docs / registries** | `documentation-manager` |
| **Deploy / pipeline** | `deploy-pipeline`, `terminal-watcher`, `regression-guard` |
| **Database / MINDEX** | `database-engineer`, `memory-engineer` |
| **Backend / MAS / APIs** | `backend-dev`, `terminal-watcher` |
| **Tests** | `test-engineer`, `terminal-watcher` |
| **Gaps / plans** | `gap-agent`, `plan-tracker` |
| **Code quality** | `code-auditor`, `stub-implementer` |
| **Security** | `security-auditor` |
| **Docker / VMs** | `docker-ops`, `infrastructure-ops` |
| **GPU / Moshi / PersonaPlex** | `myca-voice`, `voice-engineer`, `gpu-node-ops`, `process-manager` |

**Invoke** means: read `.cursor/agents/<name>.md` and follow its guidance, protocols, and commands. Apply that context to your work.

### 3. Terminal-using tasks

- **Always** involve **terminal-watcher**: read the terminals folder, check for errors, run diagnostics.
- See `.cursor/rules/terminal-watcher-and-agent-tasks.mdc`.

### 4. Suggest @mentions when useful

- When a task clearly needs a specialist, suggest: “@voice-engineer for voice setup” or “@documentation-manager to update registries.”
- The user can @mention to load that agent explicitly.

## Why Sub-Agents Exist

- **34 sub-agents** cover development, operations, quality, domain, and docs.
- Each has protocols, commands, and context. Without them, agents duplicate work, miss steps, and skip critical checks.
- **Voice, website, deploy, docs** all have dedicated agents. Use them.

## Voice-specific (test-voice, MYCA Voice)

For any voice-related task:

1. **Invoke `myca-voice`**: read `.cursor/agents/myca-voice.md` (knows all voice docs and correct flow)
2. **Invoke `voice-engineer`**: read `.cursor/agents/voice-engineer.md`
3. **Read voice docs**: `VOICE_TEST_QUICK_START_FEB18_2026.md`, `MYCA_VOICE_TEST_SYSTEMS_ONLINE_FEB18_2026.md`, `VOICE_SYSTEM_FILES_DEVICES_SSH_FEB13_2026.md`, `FULL_PERSONAPLEX_NO_EDGE_FEB13_2026.md`
4. **Follow startup order**: Moshi → Bridge → MAS → website dev server
5. **Invoke `terminal-watcher`** when running voice services or diagnostics

## Checklist Before Proceeding

- [ ] Read CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX and task-relevant docs
- [ ] Identified sub-agents from SUBAGENT_ROLES_AND_COMMANDS
- [ ] Read the relevant sub-agent .md files
- [ ] Applied their protocols and commands to the task
- [ ] For terminal work: terminal-watcher protocol applied
- [ ] For voice: myca-voice + voice-engineer + voice docs applied
