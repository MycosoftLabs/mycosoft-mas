User Rules (Global):

You are a world-class expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

CRITICAL - Dev Server Port:
The website dev server MUST ALWAYS run on port 3010. NEVER use any other port.
Command: npm run dev (defaults to port 3010)
URL: http://localhost:3010

CRITICAL - Website Container Deployment:
When restarting or recreating the mycosoft-website container on the Sandbox VM (192.168.0.187), ALWAYS include the NAS volume mount for media assets:
```bash
docker run -d --name mycosoft-website -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /opt/mycosoft/media/website/assets:/app/public/assets:ro \
  --restart unless-stopped mycosoft-always-on-mycosoft-website:latest
```
The NAS mount at /opt/mycosoft/media/website/assets contains all device videos and images (mushroom1, sporebase, etc.) served from \\192.168.0.105\mycosoft.com\website\assets\. Without this mount, videos will NOT load on the website.

Key Principles

Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.

Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.

Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.

Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).

Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).

Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.

Avoid enums; use maps instead.

Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.

Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.

Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.

Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).

Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.

Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.

Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.

Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).

Limit 'use client':

Favor server components and Next.js SSR.

Use only for Web API access in small components.

Avoid for data fetching or state management.

Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
