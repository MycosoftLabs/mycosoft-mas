# No Git LFS (All Agents) - CRITICAL

## What happened

On Feb 6, 2026, Git LFS destroyed the dev machine: PersonaPlex model files in `models/personaplex-7b-v1/` had a HuggingFace `.gitattributes` with `filter=lfs` rules. Cursor's background git integration spawned git-lfs processes in an infinite loop, each failed download leaving 7-15 GB temp files. 1,572 failures = **1.74 TB of garbage** that filled the 8TB drive and destroyed all Cursor chat history.

## Rules for ALL agents

1. **NEVER enable Git LFS** in any Mycosoft repo. Do not add `filter=lfs` to any `.gitattributes` file. Do not run `git lfs install` or `git lfs track`.

2. **If you see `.gitattributes` with `filter=lfs`** (e.g. from a HuggingFace clone or submodule), **remove those rules immediately** and flag it in your response.

3. **Large files (models, datasets, binaries >50MB):**
   - Add to `.gitignore` — never commit to git
   - Store on NAS (`\\192.168.0.105\mycosoft.com\...`), HuggingFace Hub, or cloud storage
   - Document download URL in README
   - Mount at runtime via Docker volume or symlink

4. **If you see `git-lfs` in any process list, script, or config:** flag it as a critical issue. It should never be running on any Mycosoft dev machine.

5. **If disk space is running low or the user reports slowness:** check `.git/lfs/` folder size and run `scripts/prevent-lfs-bloat.ps1`.
