# Mycosoft Full Context and Registries (All Agents)

## Scope: work affects multiple systems

All Mycosoft work can impact many systems. Agents must treat the following as in scope and consult registries/indexes before making plans, tasks, or code.

**Front-end:** Website, apps, security UI, MAS UI, memory UI, CREP, OEI, FUSARIUM, Earth Simulator, Petri Dish Simulator, Devices, About Us, ToS, Privacy Policy, Sitemap, robots, SEO, SOP, NatureOS dashboard and apps, search, search+AI+MINDEX.

**Middle:** Supabase (auth/data), Mycosoft Multi-Agent System (MYCA), ETL/scraping to MINDEX, services (e.g. MycoBrain service, device manager).

**Back-end:** FUSARIUM, MINDEX, protocols, routes, memory/MINDEX, NatureOS, APIs, services, Supabase, Cloudflare, Proxmox, Ubiquity, clouds, LLM models and APIs, databases, device firmware.

**And more:** Any other system referenced in docs or registries. The codebase is 500,000+ files across multiple repos; changes must be consistent with the full picture.

## Mandatory before any new plan, task, or implementation

**When a new agent is spun up, or a new plan/task is created, or before implementing code:**

1. **Read and use registries and indexes** so the full system is known. Do not build from ignorance or "rabbit holes."
2. **Consult (at minimum):**
   - **.cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md** – vital/current docs only (Cursor internal reference; new replaces old)
   - **docs/MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX.md** – table of contents for all docs
   - **.cursor/docs_manifest.json** – full list of all docs (path, title, repo) for discovery; regenerate with `python scripts/build_docs_manifest.py`. Cursor does not auto-read 2000+ docs or Notion; see `.cursor/rules/cursor-docs-indexing.mdc`.
   - **docs/SYSTEM_REGISTRY_FEB04_2026.md** – systems, APIs, agents, services, devices (and API endpoints for registry)
   - **docs/API_CATALOG_FEB04_2026.md** – API catalog
   - **docs/system_map.md** – system map
   - **docs/MEMORY_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX_FEB05_2026.md** – memory system (when relevant)
   - **Docs dated in the last 2 weeks** – list from `docs/` sorted by date (latest first) and read newest first for current state
3. **Align with:** sitemap, pages, apps, APIs, services, integrations, device lists, agent lists, routes, schema. If a registry or list exists for it, use it before adding or changing.
4. **When introducing new code** that adds or changes: pages, apps, APIs, routes, services, devices, agents, or schema – **update the relevant registries, indexes, and docs** (including MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX if new docs are created). Keep sitemap, API catalog, and system registry in sync with reality.

5. **When a plan or task is completed** – **create or update documentation**: create a dated completion document at plan completion; at task completion update the plan/status docs and any task log. Add new docs to MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX (and CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX if vital). See `.cursor/rules/plan-and-task-completion-docs.mdc`.

## Rule of thumb

- **Execute operations yourself:** NEVER ask the user to run deployment scripts, terminal commands, or debug in a terminal. You have terminal access—use run_terminal_cmd. Load credentials from `.credentials.local` when needed. See `.cursor/rules/agent-must-execute-operations.mdc`.
- **Full context first:** Read and use the full index/registries so the entire system is known (or as much as is relevant to the task).
- **Then plan/code:** Only after that, make plans, ideas, or implementations. This avoids chaos and duplicate or conflicting work across 500k+ files and multiple repos.
- **Index rapidly:** Use table-of-contents style indexing and existing registries so context can be loaded quickly by any agent. Prefer updating existing registries over creating scattered new lists.

## Where key indexes and registries live (MAS repo)

| Purpose | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Cursor docs index (vital/current) | .cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md |
| Master doc index | docs/MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX.md |
| System registry (systems, APIs, agents, services, devices) | docs/SYSTEM_REGISTRY_FEB04_2026.md |
| API catalog | docs/API_CATALOG_FEB04_2026.md |
| System map | docs/system_map.md |
| Memory docs index | docs/MEMORY_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX_FEB05_2026.md |
| Recent docs | docs/*.md – sort by date, read last 2 weeks first |

Website repo and other repos may have their own sitemaps, app lists, and API lists; when working there, discover and use those too.

## Multi-Root Workspace

All repos are in one workspace: `C:\Users\admin2\Desktop\MYCOSOFT\CODE\mycosoft.code-workspace`
Open via: File > Open Workspace from File. See `.cursor/rules/mycosoft-full-codebase-map.mdc` for complete repo map.

## 34 Specialized Sub-Agents

Use the right agent for the right task. All agents live in `.cursor/agents/`.

### Development Agents
| Agent | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| `backend-dev` | Python/FastAPI backend, MAS agents, API endpoints, integrations |
| `website-dev` | Next.js pages, React components, Tailwind, API routes |
| `mobile-engineer` | **Mobile responsiveness for ALL pages/apps** — iOS/Android audit, touch targets, mobile nav, breakpoints; use proactively on every new page/component |
| `dev-server-guardian` | Ensure dev server on 3010 when in Cursor; no duplicate npm servers; use `dev:next-only` only |
| `database-engineer` | PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, migrations, pgvector |
