# Cursor Docs Indexing (All Agents)

## Canonical internal reference: vital & current docs

- **First read for doc context:** `.cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md`
- That file lists **vital and current** docs only. It is updated continuously: **new docs replace old ones** in the list; do not add deprecated or superseded docs.
- **Full TOC:** `docs/MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX.md` (broader; keep in sync when adding major sections).
- **Full discovery (all docs):** `.cursor/docs_manifest.json` – generated by `python scripts/build_docs_manifest.py`. Use for search/lookup when you need to find a doc by topic or repo; then open the file by path.

## Why Cursor doesn’t “see” all 2000+ docs automatically

1. **Context limit:** Cursor does not load every file in the workspace into the conversation. The context window is limited; agents must explicitly read files or use indexes.
2. **No auto-index:** There is no built-in Cursor feature that indexes every `.md` file and injects it into context. We provide:
   - **CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md** – curated vital/current (read this first).
   - **docs_manifest.json** – full list (path, title, date, repo) so agents can discover and then open any doc.
   - **MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX.md** – full TOC with descriptions.
3. **Notion is one-way:** Docs are **pushed to Notion** for human/team reference (see `docs/NOTION_DOCS_SYNC_SYSTEM_FEB08_2026.md`). Cursor **only sees local files** in the workspace. Notion is not ingested by Cursor; to have Cursor “see” content, it must be in the repo and either listed in CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX / MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX or found via manifest/semantic search.

## Workflow

1. **Before planning or implementation:** Read `.cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md`, then open any listed doc that’s relevant.
2. **When you need a doc not in the index:** Use `.cursor/docs_manifest.json` (search by title/repo/path) or `Grep`/`Glob`/semantic search, then read the file.
3. **When you add a new vital doc:** Add it to `.cursor/CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX.md` in the right section; remove or replace any doc it supersedes. Optionally add to `docs/MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX.md`. Run `python scripts/build_docs_manifest.py` to refresh the manifest.
4. **Documentation-manager agent:** Should keep CURSOR_DOCS_INDEX and MASTER_DOCUMENT_INDEX updated and run the manifest script when many new docs are added.

## Regenerate full manifest

```bash
python scripts/build_docs_manifest.py
```

Output: `.cursor/docs_manifest.json` (path, repo, title, date for each .md in docs/ across repos).
