# API Endpoint Patterns

When creating or modifying routers in `mycosoft_mas/core/routers/`:

## Required Pattern

1. Use `APIRouter(prefix="/api/domain", tags=["domain"])`
2. Include a `/health` endpoint per router
3. Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
4. Handle errors with `HTTPException` and proper status codes
5. Use async endpoints

## Checklist After Creating Endpoints

- [ ] Router file created in `mycosoft_mas/core/routers/`
- [ ] Router imported and included in `mycosoft_mas/core/myca_main.py`
- [ ] Health check endpoint included
- [ ] Endpoints documented in `docs/API_CATALOG_FEB04_2026.md`
- [ ] No mock data -- real service connections only
