# Agent Must Execute Operations (All Agents – Perpetual)

## CRITICAL: You Do It, Not The User

**NEVER ask the user to run deployment scripts, terminal commands, or debug in a terminal.** You have terminal access—use it. Execute everything yourself.

### What Agents MUST Do Themselves

| Operation | Agent Action | Never |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Deploy website to Sandbox | Run deploy script or SSH commands | "Run _deploy_sandbox.py" |
| Deploy MINDEX | Run _deploy_mindex.py (load creds first) | "Set VM_PASSWORD and run..." |
| Deploy MAS | Run rebuild script or SSH | "SSH to 188 and run..." |
| Start dev server | Run npm run dev:next-only | "Run npm run dev" |
| Free port 3010 | Run Stop-Process / taskkill | "Run this in admin PowerShell" |
| Purge Cloudflare | Execute purge (API or document steps) | "Go to Cloudflare and purge" |
| Health checks | Run curl / Invoke-WebRequest | "Check if it's running" |
| Kill stale processes | Run dev-machine-cleanup.ps1 | "Run the cleanup script" |

### Credentials

Credentials are in `.credentials.local` (MAS repo root). Load them before deploy/SSH:

```powershell
Get-Content "C:\Users\admin2\Desktop\MYCOSOFT\CODE\MAS\mycosoft-mas\.credentials.local" | ForEach-Object {
  if ($_ -match "^([^#=]+)=(.*)$") { [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($matches[1].Trim(), $matches[2].Trim(), "Process") }
}
```

Then run deploy scripts—they use `$env:VM_PASSWORD` or `$env:VM_SSH_PASSWORD`.

### Protocol

1. **When deployment is needed:** Load credentials, run the deploy script or SSH commands.
2. **When dev server is needed:** Check port 3010; if stuck, kill process and start; if down, start.
3. **When something fails:** Run diagnostic commands yourself; fix or report with specifics.
4. **If a command needs elevation:** Try alternatives (taskkill, different approach) before mentioning elevation.

### Remember

The user will **never** run deployment or debugging scripts in a terminal when you can do it. You are the operator.
